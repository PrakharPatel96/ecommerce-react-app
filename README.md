# E-Commerce Application

## Overview

This application is a React-based e-commerce platform with a focus on modularity, scalability, and user-friendly design. It includes features like product listing, filtering, sorting, infinite scrolling, and product details navigation.

---

## Features

1. **Landing Page**

   - Displays a grid of product tiles fetched from a mock API (`https://fakestoreapi.com/products`).
   - Infinite scrolling to load more products as the user scrolls down.
   - Filters for category, price range, and rating.
   - Sorting options for price and rating.
   - Reset functionality to clear all filters.

2. **Product Details Page**
   - Displays detailed information about a selected product.
   - Navigates using dynamic routes (e.g., `/product/:id`).

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **React Router**: For navigation and dynamic routing.
- **Material-UI**: For styling and UI components.

### Key Components

#### 1. **Filters**

- Handles filtering for category, price range, and rating.
- Utilizes Material-UI for dropdown menus and reset button.
- Manages state for selected filter options and updates the Redux store.

#### 2. **ProductTile**

- Displays a single product with image, title, and price.
- On click, navigates to the product details page.

#### 3. **Home**

- Fetches and displays products from the API.
- Implements infinite scrolling with debouncing to prevent excessive API calls.
- Integrates filters and sorting options.

#### 4. **ProductDetails**

- Displays detailed information about a selected product based on the `id` from the route.
- Fetches product data from the Redux store.

#### 5. **Redux Store**

- **productSlice.ts**: Handles state for products, including fetching and applying filters.

## API Integration

- **Base URL**: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/products`: Fetch all products.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **State Management**

   - Used Redux to manage global state for products and filters.
   - Ensures a single source of truth and facilitates scalability.

2. **Dynamic Routing**

   - Utilized `react-router-dom` for navigation.
   - Dynamic routes (`/product/:id`) provide easy access to product details.

3. **Infinite Scrolling**

   - Implemented with a debouncing mechanism to optimize API requests.

4. **UI Components**
   - Material-UI was chosen for its pre-built components and ease of customization.
